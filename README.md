## Installation

```bash
cd pob-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

## Configuration

### Claude Desktop Configuration

**Mac**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

#### XML-Only (No Lua Bridge)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pob": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/pob-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "POB_DIRECTORY": "/path/to/your/Path of Building/Builds"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Full Configuration (With Lua Bridge)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pob": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/pob-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "POB_DIRECTORY": "/path/to/your/Path of Building/Builds",
        "POB_LUA_ENABLED": "true",
        "POB_FORK_PATH": "/path/to/PathOfBuilding/src",
        "POB_CMD": "/usr/local/bin/luajit",
        "POB_TIMEOUT_MS": "10000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POB_DIRECTORY` | OS-default Builds dir | Path to your PoB builds directory |
| `POB_LUA_ENABLED` | `false` | Set `"true"` to enable Lua bridge |
| `POB_FORK_PATH` | `~/Projects/PathOfBuilding/src` | Path to PathOfBuilding/src |
| `POB_CMD` | `luajit` | LuaJIT binary path |
| `POB_TIMEOUT_MS` | `10000` | Lua request timeout (ms) |
| `POE_TRADE_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable Trade API tools |
| `POE_SESSION_ID` | (none) | POESESSID cookie value, used for fetching private PoE profiles via `lua_import_character` / `lua_list_characters`. **Sensitive** — treat like a password; do not commit or share. |

### Setting Up the Lua Bridge

The Lua bridge uses PoB's actual calculation engine for accurate stats.

#### 1. Install LuaJIT
```bash
# macOS
brew install luajit

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install luajit

# Windows: download from https://luajit.org/ and add to PATH
```

#### 2. Clone PathOfBuilding
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ianderse/PathOfBuilding.git
cd PathOfBuilding
git checkout dev
```
Note the full path to the `src/` directory — that's your `POB_FORK_PATH`.

> **Note**: the JSON-RPC API now lives on the `dev` branch (the head of upstream PR [PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding#9505](https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding/pull/9505)), kept in sync with `PathOfBuildingCommunity/dev`. The older `api-stdio` branch is stale and missing recent tree-version data — using it will crash on `lua_load_build` for current-league builds.

#### 3. Verify
```bash
luajit -v
ls /path/to/PathOfBuilding/src/HeadlessWrapper.lua
```

#### 4. Update Claude Desktop config and restart Claude Desktop

### Importing a Live Character from PoE

You can import any of your live characters directly from the official Path of Exile API into the loaded build — tree, jewels, items, and skill gems are pulled from the game and applied:

```
1. lua_start
2. lua_list_characters (account_name: "YourName#1234")
3. lua_new_build  (or lua_load_build for an existing template)
4. lua_import_character (account_name: "YourName#1234", character_name: "MyChar")
5. lua_save_build (build_name: "MyChar.xml")
```

`lua_import_character` returns a before/after diff so you can see exactly what changed (stats, items per slot, skill groups, tree node count). The active spec, items, and gems are **replaced**; build notes, configuration, other specs, and other item sets are **preserved**.

**Weapon swap behavior**: by default, the import places the in-game active weapons in the primary slots and forces PoB's calc engine to use those primary slots (so PoB stats match what you actually wear in game). If you maintain a custom swap configuration in PoB (e.g. leveling weapons stored in the swap slots) and want it preserved, pass `ignore_weapon_swap: true` — that skips the swap-slot import AND leaves your existing weapon-set toggle untouched.

For **private profiles** (the PoE default), set `POE_SESSION_ID` to your `POESESSID` cookie value (32 hex chars from `pathofexile.com` cookies). Treat it like a password — never commit it. Public profiles do not need this.

## Typical Workflows

### Analyze an existing build
```
1. lua_start
2. lua_load_build (build_name: "MyBuild.xml")
3. lua_get_stats (category: "defense")
4. validate_build
5. analyze_defenses (build_name: "MyBuild.xml")
```

### Build from scratch
```
1. lua_start
2. lua_new_build (class_name: "Witch", ascendancy: "Necromancer")
3. setup_skill_with_gems (active_gem: "Summon Skeletons", support_gems: [...])
4. lua_set_tree (nodes: [...])
5. lua_get_stats
6. lua_save_build (build_name: "MySummoner.xml")
```

### Optimize passive tree
```
1. lua_load_build (build_name: "MyBuild.xml")
2. suggest_optimal_nodes (goal: "life", points_available: 5)
3. search_tree_nodes (query: "maximum life")
4. lua_get_tree   ← copy current node list
5. lua_set_tree   ← add new nodes to the list
6. lua_get_stats  ← verify improvement
7. lua_save_build ← persist
```

### Test DPS against Shaper
```
1. lua_load_build
2. set_enemy_stats (level: 84, fire_resist: 40, cold_resist: 40, lightning_resist: 40)
3. set_config (config_name: "enemyIsBoss", value: true)
4. lua_get_stats (category: "offense")
```

## Troubleshooting

### XML Features

**No builds found**
- Verify `POB_DIRECTORY` is correct and contains `.xml` files
- Check file permissions

**Parse errors**
- Open the build in PoB GUI to verify it isn't corrupted
- Ensure PoB is up to date

### Lua Bridge

**`luajit command not found`**
```bash
brew install luajit          # macOS
sudo apt-get install luajit  # Ubuntu/Debian
```
Or set `POB_CMD` to the full path (e.g., `/opt/homebrew/bin/luajit`).

**`Failed to find valid ready banner`**
`POB_FORK_PATH` must point to the directory containing `HeadlessWrapper.lua`:
```bash
ls "$POB_FORK_PATH/HeadlessWrapper.lua"   # must exist
ls "$POB_FORK_PATH/Modules/"              # must exist
```

**`Timed out waiting for response`**
- Increase `POB_TIMEOUT_MS` (try `20000`)
- Test manually: `cd "$POB_FORK_PATH" && luajit HeadlessWrapper.lua`

**Stats don't match PoB GUI**
- Check bandit/pantheon/enemy settings with `get_config`
- Ensure the correct tree spec is active in the XML
- Make sure your PathOfBuilding fork is on the `api-stdio` branch and up to date

**Bridge becomes unresponsive**
```
lua_stop → wait a moment → lua_start
```
If still unresponsive, restart Claude Desktop.

**Nodes dropped after `lua_set_tree`**
Nodes must form a valid connected path from the class starting node. Disconnected nodes are silently dropped by PoB. Ensure all intermediate nodes are included.

**`lua_save_build` doesn't persist gem changes**
Gem modifications made via `add_gem`, `set_gem_level`, `set_gem_quality` are currently held in Lua memory and are not serialized back to the XML on save. This is a known limitation.

---

## Development

```bash
npm run build   # compile TypeScript
npm run dev     # watch mode
```

## Path of Building XML Structure

PoB builds are XML files with:
- `<Build>`: Character info and stats
- `<Tree>`: Passive skill tree node allocations
- `<Skills>`: Socket groups and gem links
- `<Items>`: Equipped items
- `<Notes>`: Build notes
